# iPlug 2 Dependencies

Several small 3rd party libraries are included directly but there are some things such as plug-in SDKs that you have to install.

Some optional dependencies can be downloaded and built locally using scripts in the Extras and IGraphics sub-folders. Alternatively, you can download pre-built versions that are generated by continuous integration servers.

The subfolder "Build" should contain these built libraries with sub-folders for each platform.

You can download the zip file for your platform by running the shell script **download-prebuilt-libs.sh** from a posix terminal (macOS terminal or windows git bash/mingw terminal) 

## macOS

Pre-built macOS dependencies can be downloaded here: [IPLUG2_DEPS_MAC.zip](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/releases/download/setup/IPLUG2_DEPS_MAC.zip)

The contents of the zip files IPLUG2_DEPS_MAC.zip should be extracted to iPlug2/Dependencies/Build so it looks like this...

```
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/bin
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/include
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/lib
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/share
```

## Windows

Pre-built Windows dependencies can be downloaded here: [IPLUG2_DEPS_WIN.zip](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/releases/download/setup/IPLUG2_DEPS_WIN.zip)

The contents of the zip files IPLUG2_DEPS_WIN.zip should be extracted to iPlug2/Dependencies/Build so it looks like this...

```
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/win/src
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/win/x64
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/win/win32
```
